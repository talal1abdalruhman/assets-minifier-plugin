Assets Minifier Plugin
=====================

What is this?
-------------
This project offers a Maven plugin designed to "minify" web resources with an emphasis on safety. 
The primary goal is to reduce file size without making any significant changes to the content or achieving the 
smallest possible size. Instead, it focuses on providing a reliable reduction in file size in most situations.
